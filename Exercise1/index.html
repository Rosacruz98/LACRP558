<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi Class!<br>My name is<b> Rosa Cruz</b> and I am a senior in Environmental Science with a GIS minor. I will be on campus this semester. I have taken three GIS classes in previous semesters. This semester I will be taking two GIS classes including this course. I currently do not have any experience with coding.  This semester I hope to expand my knowledge of GIS by learning how to incorporate coding. </p>
