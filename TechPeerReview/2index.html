<h1>Emma Bravard - ArcGis Online</h1>
<p>The second technology report I chose to do was on ArcGis Online by Emma Bravard. I liked that they included background information over their topic to better understand how the program works and the capabilities. When explaining how to use ArcGis online, the author went well into detail. They explained all steps from the first step which is importing data to the very last step which is how to save and share the map. The screen captures were very useful in the example because they helped to clearly explain the steps, I liked that there was a screen capture associated with most of the steps, it was very helpful. Overall I think the explanations and the order of the steps was very concise.
</p>
<p>In the report the author mentions that there are many visual capabilities such as creating 3D maps. I think the author could have included how to use 3D maps in ArcGis online. I think they should have done a quick overview of the other visual capabilities offered through ArcGis Online. Another thing that was mentioned were some of the different kinds of layers and maps that ArcGis can display and a quick overview or just visual examples like screen captures of what they would look could have also been helpful. They didnâ€™t include any cons or issues you might run into when using ArcGis online, that could be useful when determining if this is a program you would want to use in the final project.
</p>
    <p>After reading the report I think that this program could be useful in my final project. The way I would use this is by importing vector layers that have previously been downloaded from other sources, for example files from geodata.Iowa.gov. where a lot of Iowa data can be found. It seems like ArcGis Online would make it easy to change different different attributes of my maps such as symbols since options like unique symbols are provided on the website. It seems to have a lot of options on how to display your data and do it in a fast and user friendly way which could be very helpful.
