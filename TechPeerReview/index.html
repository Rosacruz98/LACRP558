<h1>Caroline Murray - Creating a Heat map</h1>
<p>I decided to peer review the technology report on creating a heat map by Caroline Murray. It was very easy to follow the report. There wasn’t too much on the page and got straight to the point. Throughout the powerpoint they had short explanations of each step that were easy to follow along with. They also included screen captures to give examples of what they were talking about so that the reader could see a visual which I liked. Their example project was a heat map of Bald Eagle Sightings at Saylorville Lake which seemed fitting for the heat map. The end result of the map was easy to read. I also liked that they included where you might run into difficulties so that if I chose to use the heat map leaflet plugin I am aware of these difficulties. 
</p>
<p>Since this was a simple plugin the author mentions there isn’t a lot of customization that can be used which is what I would have liked to have seen more of but they make it seem like there isn’t. I also wonder how they went about choosing their colors. I know that generally a scale would move up from blue to red, blue being low and red being high. In their final map it doesn’t seem to follow that. I wonder if there is a resource that helps you pick colors for making a heat map, it would have been nice if something like that could have been included. I also wonder if there is some information on choosing the size of the blob to best represent your data, for example the example project only showed two spots on the map so I would be curious to see how more spots of different sizes would look at different proximities so just a larger area with more data. They could have included some information about what kind of legend is generally associated with a heat map. They did a good job on showing how to make the plug in but I think there could have been more detail on what else should be associated with a heat map.</p>
    <p>I think this map could be very useful in a final project to represent the volume and the location of the data.It is an easy way to visualize data, people can look at it without seeing numbers and still understand what the map is trying to convey by just looking a the size and color of the spots on the map. I would use it in a final project to show for example using it to show rainfall over a large area during a certain month. For example, if the map was of the US places with the most rainfall would be red and places with little to no rainfall would be a blue color.</p>
